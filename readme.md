### 1. __WHAT RUNS JAVASCRIPT OUTSIDE THE BROWSER?__

Node.js is what runs Javascript outside the browser. Node.js which is an open source, platform-agnostic runtime environment was created for the purpose of executing javaScript code without a browser, thus enabling programmers to create full-stack(front-end and back-end) applications using only the JavaScript Language.

### 2. __NAME 5 THINGS JAVASCRIPT CAN DO?__

1. It is used to add intreractivity and behaviour to static websites
2. It is used for building back-end infrastructures and web servers(using Node.js)
3. It is used for building mobile apps(react native)
4. It is used for game developement
5. It is used for building flying robots(eg drone)

### 3. __WHEN WAS ECMAScript FIRST RELEASED?__

    ECMAScript was first released in June 1997

### 4. __HOW DO YOU LOG TO THE CONSOLE?__

We can log to the console using the console.log() method. Thus in using this method, whatever we have within the brackets is loged to the console. For example, if I run console.log("Hello"), this will log Hello to the console.

        console.log("Hello") // Hello

### 5. __LIST THE TECH FIELDS THAT USES JAVASCRIPT.__

The follwing are the tech filds that uses Javascript;

- FrontEnd
- BackEnd
- Mobile Development
- Game development
- Internet of Things(IoT)

### 6. __DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN STATICALLY TYPED AND DYNAMICALLY TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND GIVE EXAMPLES OF LANGUAGES THAT FALL UNDER EACH CATEGORY.__

In staticlly typed programming languages, the data type of a value is determinded at compile-time. This means that at the time the code is written, the programmer must specify what data type each variable is and this cannot change during runtime.

On the other hand, in dynamically typed programming languages the data type of a value is determined at runtime and not at compile time. Hence the programmer does not need to specify the data type when writing his code as the type of a variable can change dynamically based on the value it holds

The following are statically typed programming languages;

- C
- C++
- Java
- Rust
- Go

The following are dynamically typed programming languages;

- Javascript
- Python
- PHP
- Ruby
- Perl

### 7. __DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPE NULL AND UNDEFINED__

Null is a value that can be explicitly assigned to a variable to represent the absence of a value. It is a deliberate and intentional prepresentation of the absense of a value.
e.g

    let a = null.
    console.log(a) //this will output: null

On the other hand, undefined is the default value assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.e.g

    let a;
    console.log(a) //this will output: undefined
